Introduction

This Script can do Automatic Searches on bing . It utilizes a python package called ' pyautogui ' to simulate keyboard & mouse inputs .
This is the most lightweight script for this task . This is my first project , so code & documentation may be a little messy . 
Contact me on social media for clearing doubts .

Requirements
* A Computer
* Proper internet connection
* Browser - Chrome or Edge ( Latest Version )
* Python - 3.10 or later ( check google for installation guide according to your OS )
* Packages - pyautogui,random,time ( time & random is default , you only needs to install pyautogui )

Steps for Running Script
* Install reguired package
 pip install pyautogui
* Download the latest version of script & extract it ( you can also clone this repo using git clone command )
* Change Directory using  cd ' file location ' command . replace 'file location' with exact one .
* Open Browser & make it in maximized window mode .
* Close or minimize all other windows except browser .
* Run the script using  python script.py or  python3 script.py on Powershell or Terminal ( on windowed mode on right side of the screen )
* After Running the script , click on the browser window 


Note
* Don't touch on keyboard or mouse until script execution is completed .
* if you're using it for Bing Rewards , you should logged in your account properly . I'm not responsible for suspension of your account . 
* This script is made for Windows & Linux based system . It may work on MacOS , but it didn't works on Android & iOS .
* It will do 34 PC searches + 24 Mobile Searches , not other tasks for bing rewards . 
* I'm using pyautogui , so it have less suspension chances than search bots which uses selenium . This Script interacts through serach bar of the browser ,
 So Script cannot be found using web scripting . But Chances are not zero . 
* if New releases have any issues , try older ones & notify me on instagram 
* if it works without issues , don't forget to star this repo , also subscribe to my youtube channel - Ivin Techz & follow me on social media .
  i'll update the code and add more functionalities when i'm free .
  
  NB : Open release notes for more info . Some changes can occur according to version of script
