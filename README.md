Introduction

This Script can do Automatic Searches on bing . It utilizes a python package called ' pyautogui ' to simulate keyboard & mouse inputs .
This is the most lightweight script for this task . This is my first project , So code & documentation may be a little messy . 
Contact me on social media for clearing doubts .

Note

* if you're using it for Bing Rewards , you should logged in your account properly . I'm not responsible for suspension of your account . 
* This script is made for Windows & Linux based system . It may work on MacOS , but it didn't works on Android & iOS .
* It will only do PC searches , not mobile searches and other tasks for bing rewards . 
* I'm using pyautogui , so it have less suspension chances than search bots which uses selenium . This Script interacts through serach bar of the browser ,
 So Script cannot be found using web scripting . But Chances are not zero .
